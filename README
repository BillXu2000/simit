Simit is a programming language designed to make it easier to write
high-performance code to simulate sparse systems.

BUILDING SIMIT:
===============
To build Simit you must install:
- Cmake 2.8.3+  (http://www.cmake.org)
- SVN   1.5+    (https://subversion.apache.org)

To perform an out-of-tree build do:
  cd <simit-directory>
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j4

In it's default mode the build system checks out googletest using
SVN on each build. To avoid this you can download googletest 1.7+
from https://code.google.com/p/googletest/, build it, and set the
GTEST_ROOT environment variable to the googletest root directory.
When cmake is run it looks for this environment variable and uses
this version of googletest instead of downloading it.

To run the test suite do:
  cd <simit-directory>
  ./build/bin/simit-test

To check a simit program do:
  cd <simit-directory>
  ./build/bin/simit-check <simit-program>

For example:
  ./build/bin/simit-check examples/springs.sim

To build Simit's documentation do:
  cd <simit-directory>
  doxygen

This will create a doc folder containing HTML documentation. Open
doc/index.html in your browser.

FOR DEVELOPERS:
===============
In addition to CMake developers might want to install:
- Flex       2.5+    (http://flex.sourceforge.net)
- GNU Bison  3.0.0+  (http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)

Flex and Bison are used to generate the Simit scanner and parser
and are needed if you want to change these.
