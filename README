Simit is a programming language designed to make it easier to write
high-performance code to simulate sparse systems.

BUILDING SIMIT:
===============
To build Simit you must first install Cmake 2.8.3 or later. See
http://www.cmake.org.

To perform an out-of-tree build do:
  cd <simit-directory>
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j4

To run the test suite do (all tests should pass):
  cd <simit-directory>
  ./build/bin/simit-test

To check a Simit program do:
  cd <simit-directory>
  ./build/bin/simit-check <simit-program>

For example:
  ./build/bin/simit-check examples/springs.sim

To build Simit's documentation do:
  cd <simit-directory>
  doxygen

This will create a doc directory containing HTML documentation.
Open doc/index.html in your browser.

FOR DEVELOPERS:
===============
In addition to CMake developers might want to install:
- Flex       2.5+    (http://flex.sourceforge.net)
- GNU Bison  3.0.0+  (http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)

Flex and Bison are used to generate the Simit scanner and parser
and are needed if you want to change these.
