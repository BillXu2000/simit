Simit is a programming language designed to make it easier to write
high-performance code to simulate sparse systems.

BUILDING SIMIT:
===============
To build Simit you must install CMake 2.8.3 or later and LLVM 3.3
or later. See http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
for a copy of CMake. If your system does not have packages for LLVM
you can download it at http://llvm.org/releases/download.html. You
must then make sure llvm-config is available in your path.

If you want to build LLVM yourself you can check it out using SVN:
  svn co https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/branches/release_33 llvm-3.3

Then build it:
  cd llvm-3.3
  ./configure --disable-terminfo --enable-optimized --enable-assertions --enable-targets=x86
  make -j8

Then set the LLVM_CONFIG environment variable to point to llvm-config:
  export LLVM_CONFIG=<path to llvm>/Release+Asserts/bin/llvm-config


To perform an out-of-tree build of Simit do:
  cd <simit-directory>
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j8

To run the test suite do (all tests should pass):
  cd <simit-directory>
  ./build/bin/simit-test

To check a Simit program do:
  cd <simit-directory>
  ./build/bin/simit-check <simit-program>

For example:
  ./build/bin/simit-check examples/springs.sim

To build Simit's documentation do:
  cd <simit-directory>
  doxygen

This will create a doc directory containing HTML documentation.
Open doc/index.html in your browser.


FOR DEVELOPERS:
===============
In addition to CMake and LLVM, developers might want to install:
- Flex       2.5+    (http://flex.sourceforge.net)
- GNU Bison  3.0.0+  (http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)

Flex and Bison are used to generate the Simit scanner and parser
and are needed if you want to change these.
