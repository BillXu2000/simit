Simit is a programming language designed to make it easier to write
high-performance code to simulate sparse systems.

DEPENDENCIES:
============
- Cmake      2.8.3+  (http://www.cmake.org)
- GNU Bison  3.0.0+  (http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
- Flex       2.5+    (http://flex.sourceforge.net)
- googletest 1.7+    (https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) OR
  SVN                (https://subversion.apache.org) 

BUILDING SIMIT:
===============
To build Simit you must first install Cmake, GNU Bison and Flex.

The following steps performs an out-of-tree build:
  cd <simit-directory>
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j4

In it's default mode the build system checks out googletest using
SVN on each build.  To avoid this you can download googletest
yourself, build it, and set the GTEST_ROOT environment variable
to the googletest root directory.  When cmake is run it looks
for this environment variable and uses this version of googletest
instead of downloading it.

To run the test suite do:
  cd <simit-directory>
  ./build/bin/simit-test

To check a simit program do:
  cd <simit-directory>
  ./build/bin/simit-check <simit-program>

For example:
  ./build/bin/simit-check examples/springs.sim

To build Simit's documentation do:
  cd <simit-directory>
  doxygen

This will create a doc folder containing HTML documentation. Open
doc/index.html in your browser.
